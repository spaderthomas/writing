I was looking for Alexander. A few months ago, my assignment had been switched
from changing out capacitors on a little patch in 440A to running integrity
checks on some of the Unchanging Sums. I liked this. Working on capacitors meant
that your hands would always smart after your Maintenance shift. The sums were
easy, though. The worst that would happen with those is that your eyes might
cross after a few hours of comparing the readouts to what was in the Manual. 

I wasn't looking for Alexander to tell him about my new assignment,
though. Well, maybe in a way. He had asked me to tell him if I saw anything out
of the ordinary, especially when I was on maintenance. This itself was out of
the ordinary. My older brother had always seemed to have a richer inner world
than anyone I knew, or some air of mystery, but in the past months I had noticed
it take a different quality. I wasn't sure if it was my maturing or a real
change on his part, and in any case I had my own life going on around me, so it
fell to the back of my mind. But I finally decided that what I'd been seeing on
my new maintenance _was_ strange. Strange in the way that Alexander can be
strange. And so I was looking for Alexander.

The best place to find Alexander was at dinner. Part of his air of mystery was
his hours of coming and going, but you could usually count on him to show up
when the steel slots opened and slid out the evening's portion. Plus, skipping
dinner was one thing that didn't fly with Ma. Our pod was big, one of the
biggest in the dome at thirty-three, but Ma made sure everyone knew there were
consequences for missing dinner more than once or twice a week. 

I spotted him at the head of one of the long, rectangular tables off to the side
of the dining area of the pod. He was sitting with five or six of our
creche-mates. I got my tray and sat down next to them.

Pop, Foley, Stew, Wino and Manny were at the table with us. Pretty much the
usual suspects when it came to Alexander and his hangers-on. Myself
included. They were talking about Wino's new maintenance. She'd just gotten
switched over to a notoriously fickle part of the Manual, but I couldn't really
make myself focus on the conversation. The more I saw the abstracted look on
Alexander's face, the more I psyched myself out thinking what he'd say when I
told him about the sums.

"It just doesn't make sense to me -- oh, hey Chare," she said as I walked up.

"Look, here, Chare knows. He worked capacitors for the last six months. Chare,
did you ever find a little way to do the capacitors a bit faster that wasn't in
the Manual?" Wino asked.

"Oh, uhm, hey Wino, yeah, I did notice once that if you don't use rosin core on
a lot of those weird patches in the 430s and 440s that it just takes a lot
better for some reason," I said. "I figured that out on accident, though," I
added, glancing at Alexander unconsciously.

"So? Did you start doing it that way?" she asked.

"Wino, don't make him self incriminate," Alexander said.

"I don't like it when you guys talk about this stuff. You make it sound like
people change the Manual for any reason they want," Pop said.

"_I'm_ not saying _I_ did anything. Take the stick out of your ass, Pop," Wino said.

"Sorry, Manual says it's got to be up there until next sleep cycle. Book seven,
chapter forty-three, right between the section on hot swapping chips and what to
when the fucking _dome_ collapses," Pop replied.

"The dome isn't going to fucking _collapse_ because I didn't walk until my feet
bled crossing the dome cleaning dust traps in the right order," Wino said. I
could tell this was a good argument. It was also an argument we had nearly
beaten to death, and probably the reason we clung to Alexander's domer
coveralls together. Ma Bell, Uncle Jerry, Mike, a lot of the folks who really
ran the pod were okay with us stretching our minds viz. the Manual, but
Alexander would _push us_ to have these arguments. Or to experiment with how
loosely the Manual could be interpreted, and how looseness correlated with
change. I think Ma Bell knew more about this than she let on, but I know
Alexander did some things that would have taken a few kilocycles off of her
life if she knew. 

"Hey," Alexander said, "keep it down. Don't be stupid." His voice was firm,
deep, not at all matching his wiry frame. But it had a certain intensity to it
that completely matched Alexander, with his glower, sharp face, dark sunken
eyes. Pop and Wino kept going at a slightly reduced volume.

"How's sums, Chare?" Stew asked me dully after halfheartedly watching them for a
few minutes. He startled me out of thought.

"Oh, uh, good, Stew. My hands are already looking better. It's pretty much as
easy as everyone says," I said. "Except for a couple of sums where you have to
switch the summing functor,," I quickly added. I looked down at my food for a
second and then gave Alexander another glance. I was not having trouble with any
summing functors. I wanted to show him the strange sums, but I had been under the
impression that whatever Alexander was interested in was between the two of us
only. Our pod was close, and the crechemates even closer, but that was
Alexander. He had never said so outright to me, but I knew there was plenty of
things he kept from us. Whatever he was looking for, I couldn't be sure who was
on the inside and who was on the outside.

Stew didn't seem to notice. "I'll take a couple of dense functors over cap
testing. It's taken me two hours longer than the Manual says every night this
week," he said with a distant sigh. I knew this was important to Stew. He was a
thin, quiet boy, also with his own inner world, but a very different one than
the intense and charismatic Alexander.

"Chare, you're having trouble with the summing functor?" Alexander asked as he
popped out of his fugue. "I worked sums a few hectocycles ago. I know what sums
you're talking about. Do you want me to show you?" he asked.

"Sure. I'm done now," I said with relief.

We left our podspace and walked together quietly until about 400. 

"What did you find?" Alexander said.

"Was I, uhm, too obvious?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"Two sums are wrong. The pages at 0xFF5A43BF and 0xFF553BF. But they're not
just wrong, they're..." I paused, trying to think of the right word to use,
"...coherently wrong," I finally settled on.

"It started three days ago. The sum on the first page was off, and eventually
I found an entropic bit. The Manual tells you how to fix entropied sectors, and
the sums came out right after. The next day, I found a bad sum on the page
dead in the middle of my sector. But what I couldn't explain was that the
offsets into both pages were the same. Location 1,347," I said.

"I
