Lao Tzu awoke the same way he had for two decacycles now, in an
unfamiliar tunnel in an unfamiliar segment of the Dome with citizens
that were not from his pod. He could not remember most of their
names. The only man he had bothered to make acquaintance with was
Tiberius Gracchus, a large, quiet man who did the same work Lao Tzu
did. 

He should have shunned anyone who did this work. It was this work that
got him here in the first place. Replating and rewelding segments and
subsegments of the Dome was difficult. It was of great irony to him
that the only citizens large and strong enough to carry the massive
plates from the slot where the Dome ouput them to wherever they were
needed were universally too large to fit through the tight service
tunnels that linked to the where the panels needed to be fit. But the
Manual said that it must be done this way -- he could not carry the
plates to the tunnels and pass off the job to a group of lithe, eager
citizens. It must be done this way. The Manual said nothing about his
right to resent the process. 

He tried to stretch out the ache in his shoulder, but it was
useless. The god damned cots they'd bickered with the Equimancers
about were nearly useless. A thin mat that barely insulated him from
the cool metal of the Dome's floor. He rubbed the sleep out of his
eyes. The other citizens, six or seven in total, slept. He could see
Tiberius Gracchus kneeling down, recording readings from the tests
they'd run overnight. 

On the floor was the familiar device -- an articulating tripod that
held a half-sphere which whirred softly as it scanned back and
forth. It had been scanning all night, running slowly across the
panels as if clockwork. It was pure machine. The readouts on the dim
panel where the tripod met the scanner looked very bad to Lao Tzu. 

"Seal, good," Tiberius Gracchus read off to him. "Tolerances,
good. Quarter mil on the top end. Diffuse sensor, fine. The molecular
stress induction is fine. Everything is fine."

"God damn it," Lao Tzu said. "Another one. We're going to have to loop
back around to 400 and check the spots we skipped over. We're going to
be sleeping on these god damned foam sheets for at least another ten
cycles."

"Sure. And we're not going to find anything." Tiberius Gracchus
said. "Have you thought over my theory?"

Lao Tzu had. He didn't want to let on how much the theory had bothered
him. "Yeah. It still doesn't make sense. What does it even mean to
_modify_ the Dome? You never explained that. That would be like
modifying ourselves."

"Why do you trust reality so much? Look at these numbers," Tiberius
Gracchus said as he gestured at the screen. "What are these numbers?"

"Readouts," Lao Tzu replied. "Measurements of the Dome."

"They're just light. Light hits your eyes in the right way and then
you replace another panel and sleep on a foam cot and wake up with a
groan." This was the best way to get Tiberius Gracchus to talk. The
theory. He would talk about the theory for hours.

"Yeah, sure, just light. Light produced by raw measurements from the
watchdogs, send in via comm links coming in from the core, and
tight-beamed onto my god damned scanner."

"A lot of failure points," Tiberius Gracchus said. "The Dome has
functioned according to the Manual since the birth of life. But do all
things not change, Lao Tzu?"

Lao Tzu didn't say anything. He bent down to pack up the scanner into
its travel pouch. This was not the first time they had discussed the
theory. The changing of the Dome, from without or within. Tiberius
Gracchus was not entirely sane, Lao Tzu suspected, but yet made a lot
of sense. The only thing stopping Lao Tzu from accepting his theory
was the question posed: What is change? Life is static. The Dome is
static. The world works as a clock. Each gear is built to such a
precise tolerance. When a gear spins, another gear spins, and at a
precise moment a final gear turns and the motion is set upon itself
again. 

There is no removing a gear from a clock. The entire thing will cease
to work. This is the way of things. This is how the Dome
functions. Any gear removed would have to be replaced with a gear of
exactly the same composition and dimensions. Tiberius Gracchus could
not explain that.

But Lao Tzu could not dismiss the theory out of hand. This round of
Maintenance was unlike any he had experienced in his life. The air
pressure readings coming from the Ascetics had started to come in low
about a hectocycle ago. This was not entirely unusual. Uncommon,
perhaps, but common enough that there was an entire section of the
Manual on the topic. The solution was very simple: Take pressure
readings at a set of locations, organized in concentric passes by
order of importance. If a leak is found, patch the plates that are
faulty. If no leak is found, then move zone-by-zone replacing every
plate as you go. Simple.

Lao Tzu pulled out his copy of the Manual from the pocket of his knit
domer coveralls. The next thing he had to do was create, from scratch,
a list of the locations to be checked on their next pass.

Zones could be difficult in two ways. The first way was in surface
area. Some zones were labrynthine tunnels, smaller than normal, and
packed with control rooms with wall to wall patch panels wired with
inhuman neatness. But these were uninhabited. Inhabitants complicated
things. This was the other difficulty. The matriarchs of each pod were
complicated creatures. The lack of scarcity or competition in the Dome
meant that there was not the flat and murderous affect of other
species. But that same lack of scarcity meant that any resource which
was scarce was highly competed for. Power was scarce. Any citizen
inclined enough to rise to a matriarch was deeply intelligent. Lao Tzu
knew for a fact that Ma Bell, leader of the most powerful Engineer
pod, had spent several years as an Ascete, privy to, well, who knows
what? Some said it was eldritch knowledge of a forebearer
species. Others said that there were forms of hyper ritualized
maintenance which gave psychic communion to the Dome. No matriarch was
like Ma Bell in depth, but they each had power and experience in their
own right. Getting into their zones to Maintenance, regardless of the
Manual, was difficult. Above Lao Tzu's pay grade.

The list of pods would have to be made first, so the appropriate
negotiations could be made while work was done on the tunnels. Top of
the list and farthest into the 



the first ten are where the different pods live. lower numbers are
better. they're more insulated. consider the lower numbers as closer
to the core of the section, the mother base.

each pod is set up like a large communal house. there is a common area
that is led into by seeral hallways. the ceilings are tall, maybe
twelve feet, but lower in the tunnels to seven or eight feet. the
common room has several tunnels that lead to dead ends. these are like
cul-de-sacs where crechemates have rooms. the youngest of a creche
share a room or a set of rooms. the matriarch, and whichever mates are
part of her inner circle, have another, large set of rooms at the end
of a cul-de-sac. 

this innermost room is partly an office, partly a badroom. it is
almost a lair. this is where the business of the pod gets done. not
all pods are laid out so roomily. the less presitigious the pod, the
more rooms must be shared, the less space for the head of the pod to
conduct business. the lowliest pods are just one or two rooms. 

the outermost part of this section is like a docking bay. there is a
main tunnel that connects this section to the sections that
produce. there is a patchwork feeling here. the citizens have
repurposed many of the things the dome produces in order to do some
primitive industrializing. different kinds of boxes, wheels, ramps,
rudimentary items have been assembled into tools that allow them to
move goods back and forth. there are small, busy, loud shops where
specialty foods are sold, trinkets and knick knacks are traded. a
bazaar. 

the loading dock brushes against some of the poorer, outer pods. they
form a U shape. filling in the U is a labrynthine tangle of tunnels
and control rooms that run some critical functions of the dome. air
purification, material decomposition, switching and networking, almost
devops in nature. the glue.

the core of the ascetics does things like: integrity checks,
recordkeeping, canonical copy of the manual, and food production as a
safeguard to their group. 

the equivalents do transmutation. they are the hub for
production. coveralls, capacitors and resistors, tools, dome plates,
they make it all here and ship it (albeit not over a long distance) to
the others. 

so the layout of the dome is like a three-way venn diagram.
